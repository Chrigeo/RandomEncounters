# Random Encounters

## Goal of the project

This project started on January, 12th 2018. Its primary goal is entertainment, so please don't expect anything serious ;p

## Design ideas - Core

Basic functionalities for the game to be considered "playable". Nothing too fancy around here.

### Creating a character

At the start of the game, we create a new character.

What the player can choose:
- Name
- Gender (does not affect gameplay)
- ...

What the player cannot choose:
- Stats (generic, balanced stats for all starting characters)
- Starting equipment (basic set)
- ...

### Generating random encounters

- Generate unique monster (name, stats, gear, drops ...)
- Battle system (turn-based RPG battle)

### Gear up

- "Village" menu : central hub where the player can:
    - upgrade their equipment 
    - begin next combat
    - ...

## Design ideas - Next step

Once the core game is complete, its basic concept may be enhanced, preferably in the following order.

### Character evolution

### Generating pieces of equipment

### Generating locations

### World lore

### Monsters lore

### Enhanced character evolution
